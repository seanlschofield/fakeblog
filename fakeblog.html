      <h2>About Sean</h2>
      <p>Sean has been photographing weddings and portraits since 2001. He went
        to school at Antonelli Institute in Erdenheim, PA where he got his
        associates degree, then continued on to Brooks Institute of Photography
        in Santa Barbara, CA where he got his bachelors in portraiture and
        photojournalism. Sean has since been running his own business and
        freelancing in the wedding and portrait industry. Recently, Sean became
        tired of running his own business and started disliking taking
        photographs, so he decided to take on a new career in coding with the
        goal of becoming a developer in the gaming industry.</p>
